## Description of Project
This exercise combined the use of Strapi & Postman to make changes through an API server. The Shopping Cart exercise required a specific database of stock items, with their listed price and country and description to be viewed. This portion is the backend information that would be adjusted when the frontend UI would place the items into their cart. The stock items would need to decrease and update to show how many items were still available and to show the pricing of the items that the client would be purchasing. In order to run this program make sure to download all the files into one location. Fire up the terminal and run your http-server to find the React application.
